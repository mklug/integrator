# integrator

Python implementation of several ODE IVP solvers.  Namely, the following methods (all of which are Runge-Kutta methods) are included:
- Euler
- midpoint
- leapfrog 
- trapazoidal
- backward Euler
- $y$-midpoint
I enjoyed learning about these methods in "Differential Equations, Mechanics, and Computation" by Palais and Palais.
