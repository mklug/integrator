# integrator

Python implementation of several ODE IVP solvers.  Namely, the following methods (all of which are Runge-Kutta methods) are included:
- Euler
- midpoint
- leapfrog 
- trapazoidal
- backward Euler
- $y$-midpoint
- second-order Taylor

I enjoyed learning about many of these methods in "Differential Equations, Mechanics, and Computation" by Palais and Palais.  There are also some helper methods, namely, an implementation of Newton's method (used for the implicit methods) and a function for taking partial derivatives (used in the second-order Taylor method).
